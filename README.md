# Raycity-CustomDB-backup
## This DB can't join field, don't ask me about these infos.

 Forked from THunterTK(also known as Daily), my own backup files of databases, worked with Raycity 1.580 servers.

 May works with MSSQL 2008, but I build this database with MSSQL 2017.

 Feel free to fork, clone, edit, and contribute.
